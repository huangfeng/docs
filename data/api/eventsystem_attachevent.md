attachEvent
=============

@short:
	attaches the handler to an inner event of the component (allows behaviour customizations)

@params:
- type		string			the event name, case-insensitive
- functor	function		the function object or name
* id		id		the event id

@callback:
- ...mixed...		function	the callback receives different set of parameters for different events. Check the documentation of the related events.

@callbackreturns:
- result	boolean		returning <i>false</i> will block the default behaviour (works not for all events, check the details below).

@returns:
	event id		id	the id of the attached event handler

@example:
dtable.attachEvent("onAfterLoad",function(){
	this.select(2);
})

@descr:

### How the handler is provided

You can use the method with an inline function or 
provide just the global function reference. In the second case, 
be sure that the function is visible from the calling point. 


~~~js
function doTask(){ ... };
dtable.attachEvent("onBeforeLoad", doTask); //uses the reference
dtable.attachEvent("onBeforeLoad", "doTask"); //will work as well, but not recommended
~~~

### The handler id

The last parameter allows you to define the id of the attached handler. 
If it was not specified, some unique value will be assigned as the id.
The only purpose of such id - [detaching the handler from an event](datatable/events_handling.md#methodattachevent)
(in most cases you don't need to care about the handler's id).


### Callback

Check the related documentation to get the full list of parameters. The amount and meaning will vary for different events.

The value which is returned by an event can change behavior of component. Returning <i>true</i> or <i>nothing</i> will be considered as the positive signal, while returning <i>false</i> will be considered as a signal to stop the current activity. 

~~~js
dtable.attachEvent("onBeforeSelect", function(id){
    if (id == 123)
		return false; //blocks selection of a specific element
});
~~~

### Multiple handlers

You can attach multiple handlers to one and the same event and they won't overwrite each other. 
If some of handlers will return <i>false</i> - the related operation will be blocked. 

Event handlers are processed in the same order as they were attached.
